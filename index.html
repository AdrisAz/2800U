<h1>What we do</h1>
<p id="Open"> Ontario Food mart is a new company that delivers food right to your doorsteps.
  We store and take care of the produce in our warehouses daily. All produce needs to be
  approved and pass a safety and hazard test before being sent out so all deliverables
  will be safe to consume. Our prices also match those of the cheapest grocery stores, and
  if you find one where an item goes for less let us know and we'll charge you that stores price.
  Deliveries are usually between 1-2 hours, and have a delivery rate of 5%. Which is much
  lower than the average.
